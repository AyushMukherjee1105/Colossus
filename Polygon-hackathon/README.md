# Classic, Easy to understand Hard Hat Project 

This project showcases a simple application of the Hardhat development environment. It includes a contract and a corresponding test case, a script that deploys the contract, and a task implementation that lists the available accounts. This serves as a basic example of how to use Hardhat for developing and testing smart contracts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
